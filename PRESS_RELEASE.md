# GitHub Bounties #

## Summary ##
  GitHub Bounties is a marketplace that connects software engineers with companies willing to pay for contract work.

## Problem ##
  Software engineering talent is in high demand. Many companies are willing to pay developers for contract work but are unable to find the talent they need.

## Solution ##
  GitHub Bounties connects software engineers with companies that are willing to pay developers for contract work. Companies can add a bounty fee (USD or Bitcoin) to any GitHub issue, and developers that resolve those issues will automatically be issued payment for their work.
